## Neutron_Star
1. Scaled_TOV.py : Contains Python code for solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for a neutron star. It also generates plots for the pressure and mass profiles of a single neutron star under the "PR_MR_Plot" module.
2. MR_System.py : Contains Python code for solving the TOV equations for a system of neutron stars. The script produces mass-radius plots for the system under the "mass_radius_plot_system" module.
3. tidal_love_number_vs_C.py : Contains Python code for calculating the tidal Love number of a neutron star and plotting it as a function of the compactness parameter C. The script produces k2-C plots for the system under the "k2_VS_C" module.

## Boson_Star
1. BosonStar(unscaled).py: Contains code for modeling boson stars by solving the appropriate EKG field equations. This script generates ADM mass vs radius plots for boson stars under "BosonStar(unscaled)" module.
2. ComplexBosonStar.py, ComplexProcaSelfIntercating.py, complex_scalar_star_solver.py, complex_vector_star_selfinteracting: A Python script for solving the differential equations associated with Boson and Proca stars and producing corresponding mass-radius plots under "overview_scalar" and "overview_vector" modules.
3. Units.py , BS.ipynb : Contains Python code for solving the EKG equations for a system of boson stars. The script produces mass-radius and mass-scalar field plots for the system under the "MR_MPhi" module.

## Two-Fluid Model
1. TOV_two_fluid.py : Contains Python code for solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for a single two fluid star. It also generates plots for the pressure and mass profiles of a single neutron star under the "TwoFluid_PR_MR" module.
